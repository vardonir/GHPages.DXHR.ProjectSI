## About Project SI-X

Project SI-X is a "little" "side" project that I've been working on-and-off since around Sept 2021. The goal is to re-create the environments from *Deus Ex: Human Revolution* in Unreal Engine 5 using a combination of assets extracted directly from the game files using tools from several devs (but predominantly [rrika](https://github.com/rrika/dxhr)  and [semory](http://www.xnalara.org/viewtopic.php?p=79453)) and meshes ripped using [NinjaRipper 2.09b](https://ninjaripper.com/). 

The original goal was to re-create the Sarif Industries HQ (atrium + offices + labs), hence "SI", but I've expanded to include the entire Detroit metro area since then, hence "-X", among many other things.

## About *Deus Ex Human Revolution*

It's a great game. [Go check it out, it goes on sale on Steam pretty often.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/238010/Deus_Ex_Human_Revolution__Directors_Cut/) [It's also on GOG, which is where I got it because the Steam version is region locked for some reason.](https://www.gog.com/en/game/deus_ex_human_revolution_directors_cut)

Insert obligatory disclaimer here about how I don't own the intellectual property, etc etc., this is just a small thing made by a fan. As for who does own it, you'll have to check the news, because as of writing (Aug 2022), it's still in the process of exchanging hands.

## About Me

I'm a hypercaffeinated programmer with a one-track mind who wanted to make something pretty and really needs to learn the meaning of "scope creep".
