I was running into so many issues with trying to make the game look "better," like more realistic-ish, something that looks "modern," so I gave up on it for a while. I thought I was officially done with this project after that, since I didn't want to keep going with it anymore...

And then I realized - I should slap a toon shader on it and make it look like anime, because I'm *the* fcking weeb who also made the DXHR Japanese voice mod. 

It still has the "3D Anime" look though, but I'm okay with that for now.

This also saves me the trouble of properly lighting the whole thing (that said, I've already done that for the city_sarif map...)

Aside: some materials don't work because I've already modified them to use the Quixel materials - that'll be "fixed" (i.e., roll back the changes) in the next post.
