For some reason, the HUD toggle mod crashes my game. 

So, HUD.

Also, it's really weird for me to play this game with KB+M, but I ~~can't find my controller~~ am too lazy to get the controller from the next room...

There's a bunch of weird artifacts around the floor/walls where the two meshes meet. Still not sure what's causing that, but I'm working on it.
