I"ð<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Deusex/comments/whs7ox/a_first_demo_in_my_project_to_recreate/">6th of August 2022, I made a post on reddit</a> about a little project that Iâ€™ve been keeping quiet about for more than a year.</p>

<p>I took something that I threw together for the past month, added a camera and looked up how UE5â€™s sequence editor works, and made this.</p>

<p>This demo in particular combines the background in the VTOLâ€™s interior as shown in the scene before you start the mission in the Manufacturing Plant and the helipad behind the SI building. The helipad set is very much a work in progress; I had to use some surfaces from the Megascans library for the helipad surface itself to make the demo look presentable.</p>
