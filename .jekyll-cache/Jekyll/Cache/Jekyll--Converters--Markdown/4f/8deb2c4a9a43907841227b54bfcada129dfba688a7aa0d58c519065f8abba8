<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Deusex/comments/whs7ox/a_first_demo_in_my_project_to_recreate/">6th of August 2022, I made a post on reddit</a> about a little project that I‚Äôve been keeping quiet about for more than a year.</p>

<p>I took something that I threw together for the past month, added a camera and looked up how UE5‚Äôs sequence editor works, and made this.</p>

<p>This demo in particular combines the background in the VTOL‚Äôs interior as shown in the scene before you start the mission in the Manufacturing Plant and the helipad behind the SI building. The helipad set is very much a work in progress; I had to use some surfaces from the Megascans library for the helipad surface itself to make the demo look presentable.</p>

<p>The light used in the demo is directional, I rotated it a bit as the animation ran.</p>

<p>fun fact: if you run Ninja Ripper on the VTOL scene, you actually get to see Jensen‚Äôs jacket just hanging there next to him. The camera doesn‚Äôt show it since the entire scene focuses on the two of them, but it‚Äôs there. textures and all.

<p>another fun fact: the VTOL has no fourth wall

<p>It‚Äôs still on the very early stages so I‚Äôm still only 10% into texturing it, but I do have some shots of the meshes</p>

<p>fun fact: As far as I know, there are no scenes with Malik in the VTOL that are not pre-rendered. Now, they mention in the dev commentary that the scene where Jensen walks in the VTOL to talk to Sarif for the first mission was not supposed to be pre-rendered, but it turns out that the interior of the VTOL does come with textures, as well.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a note there that says ‚ÄúInsha‚Äôallah day by day,‚Äù which I believe supports that bit in one of the novellas which mentions that Malik is Muslim. That‚Äôs pretty neat.</p>

<p>The SI building facade looks a bit like a Borg cube with just the bare textures lmao</p>

<p>I think I got everything to look right, except for the normals. The engravings in-game look a lot deeper compared to anything I can set-up on UE5 a
